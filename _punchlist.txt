  generate quaternion from euler angle based on latitude
  use relative not absolute transformation in z
+ review quaternions
+ update shadow position *in process*
+ update shadow redrawing and debug
+ understand vertex logic
/ fill triangles as shapes
/ shadow blur transparent gradient
/ draw hours as type logic
/ canvas fonts, roman numerals

  see pp.4-5:
  iterate 15Â° turns to get rotation angles from base of gnomon
  then apply rotation to the hour ticks individually
+ animate hours
+ gnomon angle logic
+ animate gnomon
+ animate shadow
+ animate fake gyro data
+ sunrise / sunset
  determines when shadow shows or not

/ shadow logic
    currently uses a date object, not a value! ** fix **

- callback get latitude logic, timing, checkSun 
  certain things need to happen before others
  include init() function to trigger all else?
  or init() and start()
- var latitude scope and callback

/ gnomon always starts pointing north
  and rotated to correct orientation
  need to work out order of transformations and correct naming
  should not be updateHeadingNorth
  but should apply to gnomon and to hours
  essentially should be a global transform but has to be in proper order

- debug debug flag

- google analytics turn on
